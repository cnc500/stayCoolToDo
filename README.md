  This project keeps track of the "to do" items that the user needs to complete.  The user writes these "to do" items/notes and the application saves these notes upon the user choosing to save them. The notes are saved in the left hand column until the user selects them when they will appear in the right-hand column. If the user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then the user is presented with empty fieldsto enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
